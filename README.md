Note: Code is Located in CSC433Homework1/src. The files I wrote are Source.cpp, Utils.cpp, Includes.h.

Errors:
PPM P6 image processor does not remove comments, so images
with comments in them will not work.


Extra Credit:
I used Homogeneous coordinates for matricies and also used 
matricies(translation, rotation, scaling) for getting the
source image pixels.

Not sure if these counts since it was not listed, I wrote my
own PPM P6 file format processor. As stated above, it does
not work with images containing comments in them, but all
other functionality works. A library would have done the 
same, but I thought it would be better to get some 
experience and deeper understanding of how the file works.

Also uses OpenGL for rendering with shaders. Not related to the
assignment but I think its a cool feature that its own window
appears and that I used a more advanced topic for the course
for this assignment.
